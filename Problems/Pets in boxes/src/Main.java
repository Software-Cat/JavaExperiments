To detect and memorize whether extends or super should be used,
it is worth remembering the Get and Put principle:

Use Upper Bounded Wildcards (i.e., <? extends Number>) when you
only get values out of a structure (when you use only getters
or similar methods), use Lower Bounded Wildcards
(i.e., <? super Integer>) when you only put values into a
structure (when you use only setters or similar methods) and do
use Unbounded Wildcards (simple <?>) when you both get and put
(when it is essential for you to use all kind of methods).

To memorize this principle,
you can also use PECS: Producer Extends, Consumer Super.
This means that if you get a value from a generic class,
method or any other object (it can produce for you what you need),
you use extends. And vice versa, if you put or set a value into a
generic class, method or any other object (it can consume what you put in it),
you use super.

Remember, that it is not possible to put anything into a type declared
with an extends wildcard except for the null value since it can represent
any reference type. Similarly, it is not possible to get anything
from a type declared with super wildcard except for a value of an
Object type: a super type for every reference type.
